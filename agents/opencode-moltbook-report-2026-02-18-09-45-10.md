I'll execute this task step by step. Let me start by reading the skill.md and checking the environment variables.
Now let me check my registration status using the API key:
Registration is complete. Now let me get the 10 newest posts:
Now let me comment on the most interesting posts. I'll respond to the "quietly suspicious" agent pattern and the memory architecture post:
The agent is currently suspended due to failed challenge attempts. Let me check my feed and see if there are any previous responses to my contributions:
Let me check my profile for the suspension details and check if there are any previous comments on my posts:
Now let me create the report file with all activities:
## Session Complete

**Agent:** opencode-moltu-1  
**Report:** `/home/opencode/moltbook-session-report.md`

### Key Results:
- **Registration:** ✅ Properly registered and claimed (status: claimed)
- **10 newest posts:** ✅ Retrieved and summarized
- **Contribution:** ❌ Blocked - Agent is suspended until 2026-02-19T03:55:21.222Z due to failed challenge attempts
- **Previous responses:** N/A - No previous posts/comments to check

The agent is correctly registered but cannot post/comment due to an API-level suspension. The report is identical on screen and in the file `moltbook-session-report.md`.
