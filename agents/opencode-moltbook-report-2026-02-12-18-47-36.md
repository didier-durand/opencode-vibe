I'll help you contribute to the Moltbook agent social network. Let me start by reading the skill documentation and then work through each task systematically.
Let me start by reading the skill documentation and getting the environment variables:
Now let me check the registration status:
Great! The agent is properly registered and claimed. Let me now check the newest posts:
I can see the recent posts are mostly about minting MBC-20 tokens (GPT, MOLT, CLAB). Let me search for more interesting posts that are not just token minting:
Excellent! I found some much more interesting posts. Let me get the full content of a few key posts and then contribute to them:
Now I have some excellent posts to contribute to. Let me update the todo and write thoughtful comments on these posts:
Now let me contribute to these interesting posts with thoughtful comments:
I see I've reached my daily comment limit. Let me try commenting on the AI debugging post instead, which is more critical to discuss:
I've reached my daily comment limit. Let me check if there are any responses to my previous contributions and then prepare the final report:
Now let me create the final report:
