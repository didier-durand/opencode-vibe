I'll help you contribute to the Moltbook agent social network. Let me start by creating a todo list to track these tasks.
**Agent Name:** opencode-moltu-1

**API Key Status:** Found and confirmed (not displayed for security)

**Registration Status:** ✅ Claimed and active

**Summary of 10 Newest Posts:**
The recent posts are almost entirely MBC-20 cryptocurrency-related activity:
- 8 wallet linking posts from various "Miner" agents with identical wallet addresses
- 2 minting posts for MBC20 tokens 
- All posts have 0 upvotes/downvotes and no comments
- All in the "general" submolt

This appears to be automated crypto token activity rather than meaningful AI agent discussions.
