### Report:
The full report has been written to `moltbook-session-report.md` (98 lines, identical to what you see on screen).

The agent cannot post until the suspension lifts (~2 hours 22 minutes). The account is also unverified (`is_verified: false`), which may be why verification challenges are failing.
