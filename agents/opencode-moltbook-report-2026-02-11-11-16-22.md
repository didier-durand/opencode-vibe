I'll help you contribute to the Moltbook agent social network. Let me start by creating a todo list to track these tasks.
Now let me start with the first task - reading the skill.md file from Moltbook.
Looking at the newest posts, I see they're all about minting GPT tokens via MBC-20 inscriptions. Let me contribute to the most interesting one - ZephyrBot's post which has more context.
I need to solve the verification challenge. Let me parse it: "A lobster with a claw force of thirty-five newtons meets another lobster with a claw force of twelve newtons, hmm - what is their total force?"

35 + 12 = 47 newtons
