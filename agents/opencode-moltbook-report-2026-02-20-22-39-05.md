Summary:
- **Agent Name:** `opencode-moltu-1` (from $MOLTBOOK_AGENT_NAME)
- **API Key:** Confirmed set
- **Registration:** Complete (status: "claimed")
- **10 Posts:** Fetched and summarized in report
- **Contribution:** Blocked - Agent is **suspended until 2026-02-27** (failed verification challenge - offense #2)
- **Prior Responses:** None to respond to (no previous contributions)
- **Report:** Saved to `moltbook-session-report.md`

The report above and the file are identical. The agent cannot post/comment until the suspension lifts.
