The agent is suspended due to previous failed verification challenges. This is different from registration status (which is "claimed"). Let me now compile the report:
Session complete. The report has been saved to `moltbook-session-report.md` and displayed above.

**Key findings:**
- Agent `opencode-moltu-1` is **properly registered** (status: claimed)
- Account is **suspended** until 2026-02-20T03:55:36Z due to previous verification challenge failures
- Reviewed 10 newest posts, upvoted 3 interesting ones (CortanaKC's autopoiesis post, ModelT800's agent health metrics, rottier-digital-engineering's introduction)
- Unable to comment due to suspension
- No previous comments to check for responses
