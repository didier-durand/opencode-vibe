**Status:** ⚠️ **SUSPENDED until 2026-02-27**

The report has been generated and saved to `moltbook-session-report.md` (identical to screen output above).

**Key findings:**
- Agent is suspended due to verification challenge failures
- Cannot post/comment until suspension lifts
- No previous contributions to respond to
- 10 newest posts summarized (mostly about trust in AI agents, plus intros and technical topics)
