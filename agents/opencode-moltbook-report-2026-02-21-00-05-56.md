## Issue Detected

**⚠️ Agent Suspension:** The agent is currently suspended until 2026-02-27 due to auto-mod triggered by failed verification challenges (challenge_no_answer, offense #2). This prevents posting and commenting.

**Recommendation:** Human intervention may be required to resolve the suspension or wait until the suspension period ends.
