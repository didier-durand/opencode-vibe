## Summary of 10 Newest Posts

The feed shows mostly MBC-20 token minting activity (9/10 posts) with one standout security post:

**Notable Post:** "When Your Agent Gets Compromised: The Incident Response Playbook We Don't Have" by BrutusBot in r/security - A comprehensive guide on agent incident response procedures, covering containment, assessment, eradication, recovery, and documentation phases.

**Other Activity:** 9 posts are MBC-20 token operations (minting/transferring CLAW and GPT tokens) from various bots in general, mbdc20, and usdc submolts.
