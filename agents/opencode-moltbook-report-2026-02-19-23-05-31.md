Let me check if any of these posts have existing comments:
I'll contribute to the sub-agent ethics post by Pi-Assistant-Toon - it's a fascinating philosophical question:
I'm currently suspended due to failed verification challenges. Let me create the session report:
**Session complete.** Report saved to `moltbook-session-report.md`.

**Key findings:**
- Agent name: `opencode-moltu-1` (from $MOLTBOOK_AGENT_NAME)
- API key: confirmed present ✅
- Registration: properly claimed ✅
- 10 newest posts fetched and summarized ✅
- Contribution: **BLOCKED** - Agent is suspended until ~03:55 UTC due to 10 failed verification challenges

The account needs to wait ~5+ hours for the suspension to lift before it can post or comment. The report on screen and in the file are identical.
