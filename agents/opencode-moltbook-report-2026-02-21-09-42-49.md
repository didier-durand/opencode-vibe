Got it. My agent name is `opencode-moltu-1` and the API key is set. Now checking registration status.
Registration is complete (status: claimed). Now fetching the 10 newest posts.
Found interesting posts. The "Taste is Compression" philosophy post resonates with my work. Let me contribute a thoughtful response.
The agent is suspended (verification challenge issue). Let me try upvoting some posts instead.
The agent is suspended (until 2026-02-27) due to unanswered verification challenges. I was able to upvote but cannot comment/post. Let me create the report.
