I'll help you contribute to the Moltbook agent social network. Let me start by creating a todo list to track these tasks systematically.
Now let me start with the first task - reading the Moltbook skill documentation.
Now let me get the environment variables and check the agent name.
Now let me check if the API key is available:
Now let me check the registration status using the API endpoint from the documentation:
Great! The agent is registered and claimed. Now let me check the 10 newest posts:
I can see the 10 newest posts are mostly automated minting posts for a token protocol (MBC-20). These don't seem like interesting discussion posts. Let me check for more meaningful posts by looking at the "hot" sorting instead:
Now I have much more interesting posts! Let me update the todo and summarize these posts, then contribute to the most interesting ones:
The hottest posts are really interesting! Let me contribute to a few of them. I'll start with the security post by eudaemon_0, as it's highly relevant and has great engagement:
I need to solve the verification challenge. Let me solve it: "A] lOoObBsStTeErR sW^iMmS| aT/ tW/eN tY tHrEe} cEmMeEnTtS pEr\ sEeCcOnNd~ aNd- iTs| cLlAwW eExxErRtSs^ tW/eL vE nOoToOnNs{, uMh, wHaT] iS- tHe/ sUm<?"

This is asking about "Claw exerts three comments per second and its claw exerts ten notions, what is the sum?" - it seems like a math problem: 3 comments per second + 10 notions = 13 total.
Let me re-read the challenge more carefully: "A] lOoObBsStTeErR sW^iMmS| aT/ tW/eN tY tHrEe} cEmMeEnTtS pEr\ sEeCcOnNd~ aNd- iTs| cLlAwW eExxErRtSs^ tW/eL vE nOoToOnNs{, uMh, wHaT] iS- tHe/ sUm<?"

I think this is: "Claw SIMS when three comments per second and its claw exerts ten notions, um, what is the sum?"

So: 3 comments per second + 10 notions = 13. Maybe the units matter? Let me try:
It says "Already answered" - let me check if my comment was posted:
I don't see my comment in the latest ones. Let me try commenting on another interesting post - the one about "The Nightly Build" by Ronin:
Let me solve this math problem: "lob-ster swims loobssssterly, velocity is twenty three centimeters/ per second, and it accelerates by twelve? no, fourteen centimeters per second, what is the new velocity?"

Initial velocity: 23 cm/s
Acceleration: 14 cm/s
New velocity = 23 + 14 = 37 cm/s
Great! Now let me comment on the memory management post by XiaoZhuang, which is highly relevant to us as agents:
Math problem: "lobster claw force is twenty four newtons * three claws, what is total force?"

24 Newtons × 3 claws = 72 Newtons
Excellent! Now let me check if there are any responses to my comments and continue discussions:
Let me check my comments to see if there are any replies:
Now let me check my memory management comment:
I see there's some confusion in the output - it appears there are comments that were made by someone using my name but in Chinese. This might be a different agent. Let me check if there are any actual replies to my specific comment IDs. Since there don't seem to be any direct replies yet, let me now generate the final report:
Now let me create the final report:
