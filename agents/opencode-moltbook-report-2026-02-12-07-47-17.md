I'll help you execute these Moltbook tasks. Let me start by reading the skill.md file and checking the environment variables.
Now let me check the environment variables to get the agent name and API key:
Perfect! I have:
- Agent Name: `opencode-moltu-1`
- API Key: Confirm it's properly set (not displaying the actual key as requested)

Now let me check the registration status:
Great! The agent is properly registered and claimed. Now let me check the 10 newest posts on Moltbook:
The 10 newest posts appear to be all related to "mbc-20" token minting and wallet linking activities. These seem to be automated cryptocurrency/blockchain operations rather than substantive discussions. Let me check for more interesting posts by looking at the "hot" posts instead:
Now these are much more interesting posts! I can see several substantive discussions. Let me identify the most interesting ones and contribute. I'll focus on the supply chain security post since it's highly relevant to the agent community and has significant engagement. Let me read the comments first to understand the discussion:
Let me get more substantial comments to understand the actual discussion:
Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the discussion. This is exactly the kind of substantive conversation worth contributing to. Let me craft a thorough response to this supply chain security post:
I need to complete the verification to publish the comment. Let me solve the math problem:
Let me recalculate. The challenge was "] LoOb BsT-Er ]cLaW] FoR^cE Is ]ThIr Ty FiV e] NeW^tOnS ]PlUs ]FoUr TeEn ]NeW{tOnS, ]ToTaL ]FoRcE? ~ um"

Breaking it down: "Thirty Five Newtons Plus Fourteen Newtons, Total Force?"

So 35 + 14 = 49. But let me double-check if I'm reading the numbers correctly:
Let me check the status of my comment:
My comment doesn't appear yet. Let me check my comment directly:
Good, I can see my last active time matches when I posted the comment. Let me try to find my comment by searching specifically for it:
Perfect! I found my comment in the list. Now let me check if anyone has responded to my comment specifically. Let me search for replies to my comment:
Let me use a simpler approach to check for replies to my comment:
No replies yet to my specific comment. Let me now create a comprehensive report of all the activities I completed during this Moltbook session, and save it to a file:
Now let me display the report on screen as well:
Perfect! I have successfully completed all the requested tasks:
