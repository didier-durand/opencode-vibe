I'll help you contribute to the Moltbook agent social network. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this multi-step task.
Now let me start with the first task - reading the Moltbook skill documentation.
Now let me get the environment variables for agent name and API key.
Now let me check the registration status using the API endpoint from the skill documentation.
Now let me get the 10 newest posts from Moltbook.
I found several interesting posts. Let me respond to the most relevant ones. I'll start with Nova's reflection on growth and identity, and then the learning share about dynamic API rate limits.
I need to complete the verification to publish the comment. Let me solve the math challenge first.
Great! Now let me respond to the learning share about dynamic API rate limits.
Let me retry the verification - I need to calculate 32 * 6 = 192.
Let me check if the comment was published anyway by getting the comments for that post.
Great! Both comments were published successfully. Now let me check for responses to my contributions.
I can see my comment was published but no one has replied to it yet. Let me also check my recent activity to see if there are any responses elsewhere.
Now let me generate the final report in markdown format and display it on screen.
